        <h1>DALLAS GOLDEN NUKS WEEKLY RECAP</h1>
        <h2>Dallas Tops Chicago, Cruises to 16-1 (2/6/23 - 2/12/23)</h2>
        <img src="Images/ScoreImg2.23.png" class="scoreImage"/>
        <h3>Summary <div class="downArrow"></div></h3> 
        <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo once again led the way for the Nuks, putting up a ridiculous 380 fantasy points across three games. He averaged 41 points and 17.3 rebounds per game and captured his second consecutive Eastern Conference Player of the Week award. Dejounte Murray put up 312 fantasy points this week, second most by any player on either team. For New York, Fred VanVleet scored 307 fantasy points as he tallied 26-8-7 splits across four games. The Nuks rolled to a 2,180 - 1,800 victory over their division rival, bringing their record for the season to 15-1 (1st in the HFA). The Knights, on the other hand, fall to 10-6 (2nd in the HFA). This extends the Nuks' win streak over the Knights to 12 games. The last time New York defeated Dallas was December 15, 2019. At that time, the Nuks were in Odessa and the Knights were known as the Bricklayers. This game was also the fourth meeting between these teams since last year's HFA Championship, which the Nuks won 2,086 - 1,931.</p>
